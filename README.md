# FacebookGroupMemberCounter

In celebration of my Facebook group 'FTIJPI' reaching 100k members, I built this member counter using 'Facebook graph' API, an esp8266 board, a cheap OLED display and an enclosure printed with my Prusa Mini+!

Every 30 seconds it updates with the current number of members, and it's been super reliable so far!

The group_member_counter.ino program is built specifically to query the number of members in a group
from Facebook using the 'Facebook Graph' API. It will only send over the
number if the request contains an access token generated by an admin
of the group in question (as far as I'm aware, at the time of writing). 

Credit goes to "sjsd" over at "https://www.instructables.com/Facebook-Fan-Count/" 
for the original code! I simply tweaked it for my needs & spruced it up for the 
FTIJPI community! His process of doing this is expired now since Facebook
changed it's API's and Developer App setup, so this instructional guide should serve as an updated method!

Updates needed:

. A menu system utilising buttons to view different data (maybe from different groups?)
and toggle debug mode! 

. A screensaver since OLED screens can suffer from burn-in 

. Create a server/AP so the user can connect and change credentials from their phone
